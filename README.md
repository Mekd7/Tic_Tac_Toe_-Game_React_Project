# Tic Tac Toe Game React Project

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game, built using React! This project was developed following the guidance of the React documentation and serves as my first project in learning React.

## Features

- **State Management**: Utilizes the `useState` hook to keep track of player moves and the current game state.
- **Winner Announcement**: The game checks for a winner after each move and announces the result when a player achieves three in a row.
- **User Interaction**: Players can click on the grid to make their moves, providing a simple and engaging gameplay experience.
## Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
JavaScript: The programming language used for interactive elements.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the application.
